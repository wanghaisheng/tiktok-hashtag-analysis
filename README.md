# TikTok hashtag analysis toolset 

The tool helps to download posts and videos from TikTok for a given set of hashtags over a period of time. Users can create a growing database of posts for specific hashtags which can then be used for further hashtag analysis. It uses the [TikTokApi](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api) Python package  to download the posts and uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the videos.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tiktok-hashtag-analysis.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tiktok-hashtag-analysis)

## Pre-requisites
1. Make sure you have Python 3.9 or a later version installed
2. Install the tool with pip: `pip install tiktok-hashtag-analysis`
   - Alternatively you can install directly from the latest version on GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/bellingcat/tiktok-hashtag-analysis`
3. Make sure [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) is properly installed by running the command `python -m playwright install`

You should now be ready to start using it.

### Structure of output data
```
$ tree ../data
../data
├── london
│   ├── plots
│   ├── posts.json
│   └── media
├── newyork
│   ├── plots
│   ├── posts.json
│   └── media
└── paris
│   ├── plots
│   ├── posts.json
│   └── media
```


The `data` folder contains all the downloaded data as shown in the tree diagram above. 
- Each hashtag has a folder with two subfolders `plots` and `media` that store plots of the most common co-occurring hashtags, and media downloaded from the posts. The posts are stored in the `posts.json` file, and downloaded media is stored as `.mp4` files (for videos) or audio and image files (for image galleries) in the `media` folder.


## How to use
### Post downloading
Running the `tiktok-hashtag-analysis` command with the following options will scrape posts that contain the hashtags `#london`, `#paris`, or `#newyork`:

    tiktok-hashtag-analysis london paris newyork

and will produce an output similar to the following log:

    $ tiktok-hashtag-analysis download london paris newyork
    Hashtags to scrape: ['london', 'paris', 'newyork']
    Scraped 963 posts containing the hashtag 'london'
    Scraped 961 posts containing the hashtag 'paris'
    Scraped 940 posts containing the hashtag 'newyork'
    Successfully scraped 2864 total entries

- The list of hashtags to scrape is specified as a positional argument

### Video downloading
Running the `tiktok-hashtag-analysis` script with the following options will scrape trending posts containing the hashtag `#london`:
`tiktok-hashtag-analysis london --download`

- The `--download` flag specifies that video files for scraped posts should be downloaded

Note that video downloading is a time and data rate consuming task, as a result we recommend using one hashtag at a time when using the `--download` flag to avoid complications.

## Analyzing results 
### Most common co-occurring hashtags
In addition to scraping data and downloading media, the `tiktok-hashtag-analysis` script can also analyze the frequencies of the most common co-occurring hashtags in a given set of posts.

Assume we want to analyze the 20 most frequently co-occurring hashtags in the downloaded posts of the `#london` hashtag.

- The results can be plotted and saved as a PNG file by executing the following command: 

    `tiktok-hashtag-analysis london --number 20 --plot`
    
    which will produce a figure similar to that shown below:
    <p align="center">
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18430739/166878928-d146b352-b68c-4ab4-bd2c-feb2f0140df9.png" height="500" alt="Top 20 most frequent common hashtags in posts containing the #london hashtag">
    </p>
    
    In the above plot, the highest occurrence is the `#fyp` hashtag, which is tagged in more than half of all posts containing the `#london` hashtag.

- The results can be displayed in tabular form by executing the following command:

    `tiktok-hashtag-analysis london --number 20 --table`

    which will produce a terminal output similar to the following:
    ```
    Co-occurring hashtags for #london posts
    Rank     Hashtag                        Occurrences     Frequency
